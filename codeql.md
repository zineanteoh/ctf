# Kit CTF 2022: Grep it? CodeQL it!

CodeQL, a surprisingly handy tool! Just read the instructions more carefully next time...

## Problem Statement

> Oh no, you have to do an internal audit on hundreds of Ruby projects for system command executions. You decide to write a CodeQL to ease auditing.
>
> Find ALL the system command executions marked with BAD and submit the query on the submission site to get the flag.
>
> [See challenge here](https://ctftime.org/task/24036)

## A first look at the files provided

We are given a database that contains 172 folders, where each of these folders contains a ruby script:

```
📂 project001
┣ 🎵 foo_deriverd.rb
📂 project002
┣ 🎵 foo_deriverd.rb
📂 project003
┣ 🎵 foo_deriverd.rb
...
📂 project172
┣ 🎵 foo_deriverd.rb
```

This is what one of the script look like.

```ruby
# project001/foo_derived.rb
require 'open3'

class MyApp < ActionController::Base
  index '/hello/:name' do
    rightin = params['name']
    failedni = "Justin"
    rightin = if ["admin", "root", "KITCTF"].include?(rightin)
      rightin # accept rightin as is
    else
      rightin = "Hacker"
    end

    return Open3.capture3("ls -la /tmp")[0] # BAD
  end

end
```

All of them have a similar structure.

This problem was intended to be solved using CodeQL.

But before we understand what the problem is asking for...

<b>What is CodeQL!?</b>

## What on earth is CodeQL

> On the official website, CodeQL is a "query language that [insert more info when i have internet]".

As a first-timer, that definition is not intuitive at all :(

### A little analogy

Imagine you are the cybersecurity teacher of a large class of students.

You have tasked your students to each write a ruby script and push their code to a common repository on Github.

As a teacher with great passion in cybersecurity, you are determined to find potential vulnerabilities in your students' code and inform them about it.

You start with the first student's code:

```ruby
# student001/rb_deriverd.rb
class MyApp < ActionController::Base
  index '/hello/:name' do
    instr = params['name']
    datani = "Deborah"
    return %x"ls -la #{instr}"
  end
end
```

You immediately noticed that this student has written a code that is vulnerable to RCE (remote code execution)! -- look at you, your degree in cybersecurity did not go to waste.

As the considerate teacher you are, you write an email to inform your student:

Great! With one less cybersecurity threat in this world, you proudly move on to the next students' code...

But wait, you have too many students. If you manually sift through all your students code you won't have time to watch your favorite Netflix series.

What can you do?

<b>Solution: use CodeQL!</b>

CodeQL can solve your problem of (tediously) looking for vulnerabilities within a repository! It is a _querying_ language, which means that you can define a _query_ that looks for code that are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

Here is a pseudocode:

```sql
from lines_of_code
where lines_of_code.isVulnerableTo("RCE")
select lines_of_code
```

<i>Disclaimer: while the actual CodeQL script is more complicated than this pseudocode, the general structure is the same!</i>

## Understanding the problem

So in this problem, we need to write a CodeQL query that looks for vulnerable code written in Ruby. The author of the challenge has kindly left a comment `# BAD` at the end of all suspicious lines for reference purpose 🧐

Okay. It is our task to ensure that the query we write will capture ALL the lines marked with `# BAD`. No more, no less.

## How NOT to solve this problem

At first my silly brain thought this problem was easy, since all I had to do was to write a query that looks for all lines with the comment '# BAD' that the author has kindly provided to us.

```sql
# a simplification of my code (took me >30 min to write this)
import ruby
import codeql.ruby.ast.internal.TreeSitter

from Comment c
where c.getValue() = "# BAD"
select c
```

And voila! Flag!

Right?

... well, no.

Turns out, I wasn't reading the instruction correctly, and missed out the line saying that comments will actually be stripped upon verification, so I couldn't just physically look for comments...

_Note to self: read the instructions carefully next time!!_

### How to solve this problem

Believe it or not, I learned a ton from my attempt at hardcoding the result.

After about 1-2 hours of scouring the internet, CodeQL finally made sense.

To give myself a better idea of what I needed to query, I ran the command `grep -hnr "BAD" > ../bad.txt` recursively on the folder containing the Ruby scripts to find all lines that are vulnerable to RCE.

This is what I got:

```text
14:    return %x"ls -la /tmp" # BAD
17:    Kernel.system("ls -la #{iin}") # BAD
14:    Kernel.system("ls -la /tmp") # BAD
16:    Kernel.system("ls -la /tmp") # BAD
20:    Kernel.system("ls -la #{list}") # BAD
17:    Open4.popen4("ls -la #{index}") # BAD
... (154 lines in total)
```

After some carefuly analysis, I was able to deduce that the vulnerable lines of code stemmed from:

1. Method calls to `Open4.popen4`, or
2. Method calls to `Kernel.system`, or
3. Method calls to `Open3.capture3`, or
4. Return statements containing literal strings

With the help of some [example code](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ruby/), [CodeQL's official ruby documentaion](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-standard-libraries/ruby/) and a [good YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvCd0Ee4FgE), I was able to translate the above into CodeQL:

```sql
import ruby
import codeql.ruby.AST

from AstNode a, MethodCall call, SubshellLiteral literal
where
  (call.getMethodName().matches("%popen%") and a = call) or
  (call.getMethodName().matches("%system%") and a = call) or
  (call.getMethodName().matches("%capture%") and a = call) or
  (literal.getAPrimaryQlClass() = "SubshellLiteral" and a = literal)
select a
```

And voila! This time we actually got the flag after submitting our code to the portal!
`KCTF{c0u1d_h4v3_u53d_grep_f02_7h15}` 🎉
